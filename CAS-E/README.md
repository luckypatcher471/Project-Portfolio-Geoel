# CAS-E: Social Interaction Robot

## Overview
CAS-E is a social robot designed to interact with users through speech-based communication and responsive behavior. The system integrates speech recognition, response generation, and audio output into a modular architecture.

## Objective
To design and implement an interactive robotic system capable of understanding spoken input and generating appropriate responses in real time.

## System Architecture
The system consists of:

- Speech-to-Text module for voice input processing
- Language processing module for response generation
- Text-to-Speech module for audio output
- Face tracking to acknowledge interacting user and to show anthropomorphic traits like turning heads and using hands while communicating
- Audio handling pipeline for input/output control
- Embedded hardware integration for robotic actuation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Speech Recognition (STT like vosk)
- Language model API integration(Google's gemini API is currently in consideration)
- Audio processing libraries
- Embedded system components

## Key Contributions
- Modular system design
- Real-time speech pipeline integration
- Latency optimization considerations
- Hardware-software coordination

## Current Status
The system is under continued development with focus on improving interaction naturalness and performance efficiency.
