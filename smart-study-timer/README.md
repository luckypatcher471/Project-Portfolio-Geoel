# Ultrasonic Study Timer

## Overview
A smart study timer that activates only when the user is detected within a defined distance range.

## Problem Statement
Maintaining focus during study sessions can be difficult without accountability.

## System Design
- Ultrasonic sensor for presence detection
- Microcontroller-based timer logic
- Distance threshold condition for activation

## Working Principle
The timer runs only when the user is within the set proximity range. If the user moves away, the timer pauses.

## Future Improvements
- Session tracking and data logging
- Mobile app integration
- Visual display interface
