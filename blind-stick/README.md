# Smart Assistive Blind Stick

## Overview
An Arduino-based assistive system designed to help visually impaired individuals detect nearby obstacles using ultrasonic sensing.

## Problem Statement
Visually impaired individuals may face difficulty detecting obstacles at close range while walking.

## System Design
- Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement
- Arduino microcontroller for real-time processing
- Buzzer for proximity alert

## Working Principle
When an obstacle is detected within a predefined threshold distance, the buzzer activates to alert the user.

## Learning Outcomes
- Sensor integration
- Threshold-based control logic
- Embedded system debugging
- Practical hardware implementation
